I did a PhD of psychology at Nagoya University with [Hideki Ohira](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E7yKMWUAAAAJ&hl=ja) and [Kentaro Katahira](https://sites.google.com/site/nagoyacbslab/). 
My PhD work was about _"Reinforcement Learning in Humans: Rethinking Psychologically Plausible Model-Free and Model-Based Algorithms."_ I'm interested in understanding human decision-making process using behavioral tasks and computational approach.
